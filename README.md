## 🚀 Elevator Pitch

DailyConsensus is a Reddit-native daily game that challenges the community to reach **70% agreement** on one simple, relatable question.  
Vote **Yes**, **No**, or **Depends** — and see whether Reddit can align… just for one day.

---

## 🧠 The Idea

Reddit is the internet’s largest collection of opinions.  
Agreement is rare. Debate is constant.

So we turned that into a game.

Instead of arguing endlessly, DailyConsensus creates a measurable, time-bound challenge:

> Can the community align on one shared answer within 24 hours?

If 70% agree → Reddit wins.  
If not → Reddit fails again (and that’s often more entertaining).

---

## 🎮 How It Works

### 1️⃣ One Question Per Day

Each day features:
- A lighthearted
- Universally relatable
- Non-political question

Examples:
- “Have you ever opened Reddit for 5 minutes and stayed for 2 hours?”
- “Do you read the full post before commenting?”
- “Have you ever upvoted based on vibes alone?”

---

### 2️⃣ Three Thoughtful Options

- ✅ Yes  
- ❌ No  
- 🤷 Depends  

“Depends” reflects Reddit’s nuanced culture and prevents forced binary choices.

---

### 3️⃣ Real-Time Results

After voting, users see:
- Live vote percentages
- Dynamic feedback
- Humorous, answer-based responses

---

### 4️⃣ The 70% Consensus Rule

To achieve DailyConsensus:

- One option must reach **70%+**
- Within a 24-hour window

If successful:
> 🎉 DailyConsensus Achieved

If not:
> 🤦 Reddit Failed Again

Both outcomes are entertaining.

---

### 5️⃣ Comments = Gameplay

The real strategy happens in the comment section.

Players:
- Debate
- Persuade
- Joke
- Rally others to align

DailyConsensus transforms Reddit discussion into structured, collaborative gameplay.

# 🎯 Final Thought

DailyConsensus doesn’t try to eliminate disagreement.

It gamifies it.

The real question remains:

> **Can Reddit agree… even for one day?**
